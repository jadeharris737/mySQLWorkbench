included in a sample database have been used by the successfully processed SQL

relational tables with the following names Pbasket and PP. No other relational 
tables need to be considered. The script must list the names of relational tables 
together with the total number of times each table has been used. Please, find a 
fragment of a sample output listed below.

To simplify this task, assume that a relational table is used no more than one time in 
a SQL statement.

The results must be listed in the ascending order of the relational tablesâ€™ names after 
the successfully processed SQL statements included in a script dbupdates.sql.
